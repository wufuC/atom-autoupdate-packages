## 1.2.0
* New: Find and kill the blue 'X updates(s)' icon/button at the lower right
         corner of Atom window (enabled by default; can be turned off).
         Because updates are managed by this package;)
* New: Notifications and dialogues are now aware of single/multiple update(s)
         and pluralize if necessary
* Fix: Trigger check-for-update 30 seconds after package activation,
         giving way to Atom to draw the editor window and launch other
         UI-related packages

## 1.1.2
* Fix: minimum interval between check-for-update should not be < 1 hour

## 1.1.1
* Fix: Correct a few typos in README and notification messages
