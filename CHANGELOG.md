## 1.2.1

         completely broken in future Atom versions

## 1.2.0
* New: Find and kill the blue 'X updates(s)' icon/button at the lower right
         corner of Atom window (enabled by default; can be turned off).

* New: Notifications and dialogues are now aware of single/multiple update(s)
         and pluralize if necessary
* Fix: Trigger check-for-update 30 seconds after package activation,
         giving way to Atom to draw the editor window and launch other
         UI-related packages
